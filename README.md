# Budgetier
A webpage storing data converted from sqlite database; basic budget account per month 
The uploaded version here is a sample from June 2017 with the data hardcoded (this is being switched to a different database so the current version is sort of dead). Also there is a manifest file that could convert this to a google chrome extension, but the graphs don't carry over well (read: at all) so it is what it is.
