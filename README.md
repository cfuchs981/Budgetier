# Budgetier 

This is a website that dynamically read in data from a SQLite database. The current version has a sample input hardcoded in, as I was intending to change the database source  (likely to MySQL). As it stands, this is just a website that will nicely organize and display your budget info via JSCharts. It will also keep track of monthly spending (sample display is pictured below). 

## Getting Started

To run, either clone the repository or download the zipped folder. All hardcoded data in the tables/charts would have to be altered and/or attached to  your own database. 

## Sample Output
