# Budgetier 

This is a website that dynamically read in data from a SQLite database. The current version has a sample input hardcoded in, as I was intending to change the database source  (likely to MySQL). As it stands, this is just a website that will nicely organize and display your budget info via JSCharts. It will also keep track of monthly spending (sample display is pictured below). 
On the bright side, thanks to the responsive nature of JSCharts, your graphs will load in a beautiful animated wave each time the page is called. Which means the more you spend, the better it looks. Which is...good? 

## How to Use 

To run, either clone the repository or download the zipped folder. All hardcoded data in the tables/charts would have to be altered and/or attached to  your own database.
